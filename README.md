# Bash and Batch scripts running on Linux distro for Windows.

As the commands to change IP address in cmd or powerShell are overwhelming I decided to make a script to simplify this. I am more acustomed to bash scripts and found them more usable than a batch script. I later discovered the powerShell scripts are very usable and something to look into for the future shell scripts (That is if I use windows in the future).

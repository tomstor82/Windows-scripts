As aliases are not supported in Windows Command Prompt the way it is in Bash,

I've had to create my own small batch files triggering the apps I want.

To enable the recognition of my batch files anywhere in the terminal, I added
"c:\aliases" to the system environment path in Windows.

As some files required administrative rights, I changed the 'PowerShell Properties'
to always 'run as administrator'. As the annoying pop-up alert always is triggered,
I disabled this in the 'User Account Control Settings'
